## Decoder Ring

This project contains multiple different cipher programs, who's purpose is both encoding and decoding messages given a cipher key.

# Caesar Cipher

This program works by entering a message and entering a shift value. The alphabet will shift to the right or left depending on if the shift was positive or negative.

# Polybius Cipher

This program works by entering a message. The given message can either be encoded or decoded by assigning letters to a grid. By reading two digit numbers, this program is able to navigate to that grid space and extract the letters of that space.

# Substitution Cipher

This program works by entering a message and a substitute alphabet. The given message can be either encoded or decoded using the given alphabet.
